These pipelines use two different batch correcting methods in order to visualize gene expression onto UMAP representations of post mortem human Alzheimers snRNA-seq samples. They were developed for the Integrated Bioinformatics Project by Nikolay Makarenko, Rucsanda Juncu, and Mieke Nicolaï in association with KU Leuven and Dr. Stein Aerts. 

Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease, involving unique gene expression profiles of different central nervous system (CNS) cell types. Analysis of 48,534 snRNA-seq nuclei from post mortem human Alzheimer’s and control patients was conducted using different data correction methods. Comparison of batch correcting methods (scVI and Harmony), as well as analysis of UMAP clustering and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) paths allowed for profiling of differentially expressed genes among control and diseased nuclei. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these genes revealed astrocytes having upregulation of extracellular and fibrillary proteins TNC and GFAP. Microglia expression of TREM2 was lower than expected, however, GO terms for signal transduction were strongly associated with other receptor proteins that were shown to be upregulated. Oligodendrocytes had associations with purine binding and DEGs indicating remyelination. Further exploration should be performed into clustering quality and confirming gene signals.
